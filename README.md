## About

More and more companies are producing numerous self-care products. These types of products are manufactured using various ingredients with different levels of safety.
One of the goals of the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) is to make sure that products can be safely used by the public. If a product was safe, it would be registered by the SFDA.

The purpose of this project is to provide a search engine for Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) registered products. It enables users to determine whether a certain product was registered by the SFDA or not.

## Usage example
